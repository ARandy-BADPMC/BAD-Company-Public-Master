# BAD-Company-Public-Master

Operation Chainbreaker is an ArmA 3 BAD Company project between Alex K., Jey R. & A. Randy. 
Our goal is to create a fun, laid back yet realistic ArmA 3 mission (though not as hardcore as K.Hunter's Patrol Ops @ https://github.com/KHunter-Arma/Patrol_Ops_Hz).
This is our second port of our mission on Duala and our third and hopefully final port is to Lythium.
